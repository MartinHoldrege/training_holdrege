# Introduction

Martin is making a arbitrary change

Martin makes another edit on main

- read in data

The data was sourced from [Tweedie, 2009](doi:10.18739/A25T3FZ8X)

```{r message=FALSE}
bg_chem <- read_csv("BGchem2008data.csv")

```


# Analysis

We are interested in mean nutrient concentrations. 

```{r}
nitrate <- mean(bg_chem$NO3)
nitrite <- mean(bg_chem$NO2)
amm <- mean(bg_chem$NH4)

phos <- mean(bg_chem$P)
```

- calculate mean redfield ratio

```{r echo = FALSE}
ratio <- (nitrate + nitrite + amm)/phos

plot(bg_chem$P, bg_chem$NO2 + bg_chem$NO3 + bg_chem$NH4)
```

We calculated the redfield ratio to be `r round(ratio, 2)`

- plot redfield ratio

Branch test
```{r}
a<-3
```
